Syncing components is currently handled by NAF schemas. Schemas are easy to work with, but limiting if you want more granular control of component syncing. Schemas define component sharing by template. You might want to define that by client id, or another metric provided by another plugin. I think some sort of strategy pattern should be applied to component syncing. In addition to just deciding what gets synced, there could also be modifiers such as position, or the addition of extra components clientside.
